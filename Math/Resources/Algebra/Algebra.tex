\subsection{Intervals}
Intervals are basically subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ and are commonly used in solving inequalities or in finding domains. If there are two numbers $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $a < b$, there are four types of intervals: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Open interval: $(a,b)=\{x:a<x<b\}$ i.e end points are not included. Symbols: $()$ or $][$
\item Closed interval: $[a,b]=\{x:a \le x \le b\}$ i.e end points are also included. Symbol: $[ \thinspace]$
\item Open-Closed interval: $(a,b)=\{x:a<x \le b\}$. Symbols: $( \thinspace ]$ or $]\thinspace]$
\item Closed-Open interval: $(a,b)=\{x:a \le x <b\}$. Symbols: $[ \thinspace )$ or $[\thinspace[$
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Infinite Intervals}
\begin{itemize}
\item $(a,\infty)= \{x:x>a\}$
\item $[a,\infty)=\{x:x \ge a\}$
\item $(-\infty,b)=\{x:x<b\}$
\item $(\infty,b]=\{x:x \le b\}$
\item $(-\infty,\infty)=\{x:x \in \mathbb{R}\}$
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Sets and Relations}
\subsubsection{Set}
 A collection of any kind of objects. The objects that make  up a set are called $elements$ or $members$. The statement '$a$ is an element of set $A$' can be written as $a \in A$ and set containing elements $a,b$ and $c$ is denoted by $\{a,b,c\}$. A $empty$  or $null$ set is denoted by  $\varnothing$, which is the set that contains no elements.\\
\textbf{Union(join,sum):} The union of two sets $A$ and $B$, denoted by $A \cup B$, consists of those elements that belong to $A$ or to $B$: $$A \cup B = \{x:(x \in A) \lor (x \in B)\}$$ For example, if $A$ is $\{1,2,3,4\}$ and $B$ is $\{1,4,5,6\}$ then $A \cup B$  is $\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$.\\
\textbf{Intersection(meet,product):} The intersection of two sets $A$ and $B$, denoted by $A \cap B$, consists of those elements that belong to both $A$ and $B$: $$A \cap B=\{x:(x \in A) \land (x \in B)\}$$ For example, if $A$ is $\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$ and $B$ is $\{1,4,5,6,7,8\}$ then $A \cap B$ is $\{1,4,5,6\}$.\\
\textbf{Complement:} The complement of a set $A$, denoted by $A'$ or $A^{\complement}$, consists of all those elements that are not members of $A$: $$A'=\{x:x \not \in A\}$$ For example, in the domain of natural numbers, if $A$ is set of even numbers the its complement $A'$ is the set of odd numbers.\\
\textbf{Universal Set:} Relative to a particular domain, the universal set, denoted by $\mathbf{U}$, is set of all objects of that domain:
$$\mathbf{U}=\{x:x=x\}$$
\subsubsection{Properties of sets}
\textbf{Commutative law:}
\begin{itemize}
\item $(A \cup B)=B \cup A$
\item $(A \cap B)= B \cap A$
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Associative law:}
\begin{itemize}
\item $(A \cup B) \cup C=A \cup (B \cup C)$
\item $(A \cap B) \cap C=A \cap (B \cap C)$
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Distributive law:}
\begin{itemize}
\item $A \cup (B \cap C)=(A \cup B) \cap (A \cup C)$
\item $A \cap (B \cup C)=(A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C)$
\end{itemize}
\textbf{De Morgan's law:}
\begin{itemize}
\item $(A \cup B)' = A' \cap B'$
\item $(A \cap B)' = A' \cup B'$
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Identity law:}
\begin{itemize}
\item $A \cup \mathbf{U}=A$
\item $A \cup \varnothing=A$
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Complement law:}
\begin{itemize}
\item $A \cup A' = \mathbf{U}$
\item $A \cap A'= \varnothing$
\item $(A')'=A$
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Idempotent law:}
\begin{itemize}
\item $A \cap A=A$
\item $A \cup A=A$
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Results on number of elements in sets}
If $A,B,C$ are finite sets and $\mathbf{U}$ be Universal finite set then:
\begin{itemize}
\item $n(A \cup B)= n(A) + n(B) -n(A \cap B)$
\item $n(A-B)=n(A)-n(A \cap B)$
\item $n(A \cup B \cup C)=n(A)+n(B)+n(C)-n(A \cap B)-n(B \cap C)-n(C \cap A)+n(A \cap B \cap C)$
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Relations}
An association between, or property of, two or more objects. Thus ($x=y$) and ($a$ lies between $b$ and $c$) are relations, but ($N$ is a prime) is not.
\subsubsection{Types of Relations}
\textbf{Void Relation:} Let $A$ be a set. Then $\phi \subseteq A \times A$ and so it is a relation on $A$. This relation is also called empty relation on $A$.\\
\textbf{Universal Relation:}Let $A$ be a set. Then $A\times A \subseteq A \times A$ and so it is a relation on A. This relation is called the universal relation on $A$.\\
\textbf{Identity relation:} Let $A$ be a set. Then the relation $I_A =\{(a,a):a \in A\}$is called the identity relation on $A$. In other words, a relation $I_A$ on $A$ is called the identity relation if every element of $A$ is related to itself only.\\
\textbf{Reflexive Relation:} A relation $R$ on a set $A$ is said to be reflexive if every element of $A$ is related to itself. Thus $R$ on set $A$ is not reflexive if there exits an element $a \in A$ such that $(a,a) \notin R$.\\
\textbf{Symmetric Relation:} A Relation $R$ on set $A$ is said to be symmetric if $$(a,b) \in R \implies (b,a) \in R \medspace \forall \medspace a,b \in A$$ i.e $$a \medspace R \medspace b \implies b \medspace R \medspace a \medspace \forall \medspace a,b \in A$$\\
\textbf{Transitive Relation:} A Relation $R$ on set $A$ is said to be transitive  if $(a,b) \in R$ and $(b,c) \in R$ $\implies (a,c) \in R \medspace \forall \medspace a,b,c \in A$.\\
\textbf{Equivalence Relation:} A Relation is said to be equivalence if it satisfies $reflexive,symmetric$ and $transitive$ relations.\\
\textbf{Equivalence Class:} If $R$ is an equivalence relation defined on set $A$ then the equivalence class of any element $x \in A$, denoted by $[x]$, is the set of elements to which $x$ is related by equivalence relation $R$: $$[x]=\{y:x \medspace \mathbf{R} \medspace y\}$$ For example, if $R$ is the equivalence relation (the same height as), then the equivalence class of the element $x \in A$ consists of all elements of $A$ with same height as $x$.
\section{Quadratic Equations}
29 May 2023
\subsection{Equation and Basic Results}
An equation of the form $$ax^2+bx+c=0$$ where $a \not= 0$ and $a,b,c \in \mathbb{R}$ is called a quadratic equation. The roots of quadratic equation are given by $$x=\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$$ The quantity D ($D=b^2-4ac$) is known as discriminant of equation.
\subsubsection{Results}
1. Let $\alpha$ and $\beta$ be two roots of given quadratic equation. Then

\begin{itemize}
\item $\alpha + \beta = -\frac{b}{a}$
\item $\alpha \beta=\frac{c}{a}$
\end{itemize}
2. A quadratic equation, whose roots are $\alpha$ and $\beta$ can be written as $$(x-\alpha)(x-\beta)=0$$ i.e $$ax^2+bx+c \equiv a(x-\alpha)(x-\beta)$$
3. If the quadratic equation is satisfied by more than two distinct numbers (real or complex), then it becomes an identity, i.e $$a=b=c=0$$
4. The quadratic equation has real and equal roots if and only if $D=0$ i.e $b^2-4ac=0$. \\
5. The quadratic equation has real and distinct roots if and only if $D>0$ i.e $b^2-4ac>0$. \\
6. The quadratic equation has complex roots with non-zero imaginary parts if and only if $D<0$ i.e $b^2-4ac<0$.\\
7. If $p+iq$ ($p,q \in \mathbb{R}$) is root of quadratic equation where $i=\sqrt{-1}$, the $p-iq$ is also root of quadratic equation. Provided $a,b,c \in \mathbb{R}$. \\
8. If $p+\sqrt{q}$ is an irrational root of quadratic equation, then $p-\sqrt{q}$ is also a root of equation provided that all coefficients are rational.
\subsection{Conditions for Common Root(s)}
Let $ax^2+bx+c=0$ and $dx^2+ex+f=0$ have a common root $\alpha$. Then 
$a\alpha ^{2}+b\alpha+c=0$ and $d\alpha ^{2}+e\alpha+f=0$.\\
Solving for $ \alpha^2$ and $ \alpha$ :
$$\frac{\alpha^2}{bf-ce}=\frac{\alpha}{dc-af}=\frac{1}{ae-bd} \implies$$ $$\alpha^2=\frac{bf-ce}{ae-bd}$$ and $$\alpha=\frac{dc-af}{ae-bd} \implies$$ $$(dc-af)^2=(bf-ce)(ae-bd)$$
which is a required condition for the two equation to have a common root.

\begin{itemize}
\item Condition for both the roots to be common is $\frac{a}{d}=\frac{b}{e}=\frac{c}{f}$
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Wavy Curve Method}
The Method of intervals is used for solving inequalities of the form 
$$f(x)= \frac{(x-a_1)^{n_1}(x-a_2)^{n_2}...(x-a_k)^{n_k}}{(x-b_1)^{m_1}(x-b_2)^{m_2}...(x-b_p)^{n_p}}$$
